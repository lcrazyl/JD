## Technology used:

- CSS Flexible layout
- AJAX request
- Cookie storage
- jQuery

## Experience：

The biggest gain is that you are familiar with the git operation process and master the relevant operation commands.Secondly, I reviewed the page layout and JavaScript writing and knew the shortcomings. The next step is to consolidate these shortcomings.And due to time and own ability, there are still many unrealized functions
